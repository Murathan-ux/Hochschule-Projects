# üé∂ Smart Mood-Responsive Music Generator 

## üß† Overview

The **Smart Mood-Responsive Music Generator** is a Python-based application that streams dynamically curated music from YouTube based on real-time emotional input. It offers a multi-modal mood detection system utilizing:

- **Facial Emotion Recognition** via webcam (deep learning-based),
- **Speech Emotion Recognition** via real-time voice transcription and sentiment analysis,
- **Text-Based Mood Inference** with spelling correction, keyword detection, and sentiment analysis,
- **Manual Mood Selection** for user-driven input.

Once the user's mood is inferred, the app selects and plays music from a pre-defined YouTube playlist corresponding to the detected mood. This application is useful for mood regulation, relaxation, study focus, or emotional awareness.
