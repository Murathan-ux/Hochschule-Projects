# 1 AGV Charge

## Milestone:
Basic Charging Management Simulation for Robotino AGVs
## Description:
Create a Python simulation to manage basic charging logic for multiple Robotinos and charging stations. Understand resource allocation and basic optimization principles before applying your solutions to the real world scenario.
## issues
- Define Robotino Class
- Define Charger Class
- Simulate Basic Charging Logic in a Main-Module
	initialize Robotinos, chargers
	run a simulation loop draining the batteries
- Implement Simple Resource Allocation
	allocate low-charge Robotinos to available charging stations.
- Extend simulation loop with charging logic
- Reflect: Aspects of reality vs current state of implementation
- Modify & Test: change paramaters, integrate optimizations and evaluate them
