DESCRIPTION FOR THE Files "SmartFleetCom" AND "calculate_voltage_percent"


"SmartFleetCom" file provides the link "https://wiki.openrobotino.org/SmartFestoFleetCom.html" for  essential documentation for integrating the Smart Festo Fleet Communication system into Robotino operations. In a Robotino charging concept, this resource serves as a guide for configuring communication protocols, enabling seamless fleet management. It outlines how to monitor battery levels, manage charging thresholds, and automate charging routines using FleetCom's API and software. By leveraging this information, users can design an efficient and autonomous charging system for Robotinos in IoT environments.

"calculate_voltage_percent" file showes the current battery voltages of the robotinos in the IOT Factory based on its chassis type then involves the calculation of the convertion from voltages the percentages.
